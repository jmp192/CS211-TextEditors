1) The greatest challenge I came across was on how to implement the search function in coordination with the trie tree. I reviewed 
multiple generic insert and search functions for trie trees, but struggled on how to incorprate that into this milestone with the code 
given to us. It allowed for greater functionality and relevance to the project, but was difficult to visualize with using recursion. With 
using recursion, I had trouble figuring out how to get back to the original call and branching once it had reached the end of a 
particular path. Utilizing a helper function, which wasn't apparent at first, made it much easier to figure out and implement.
2) At this moment, I am still unable to figure out how to fully integrate the finished trie tree into my text editor. I'm having trouble 
getting it to neatly output in a box, that will move as the cursor moves. Since I still don't have a switch for key operations, allowing 
the user to scroll through and highlight finished words is still out of reach.
3) I recommend taking the time to read through the material, as well as generic versions of the trie tree search and insert 
implementations, to get more familiar with what a trie tree is doing. Using a visualization program also helped me get a better idea of 
how searching should work.
4) Utilizing a helper function, the same way we implemented a helper function with the bst problem on our programming test, allowed me to 
make much needed progress on the search function. I was very relieved and proud by the end that I was able to get a trie tree to work 
properly.
5) Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to search through the tree and return a vector of finished words for the user. It 
took a lot of drawing and visualizing, so it gave me a better idea of how to approach problems in a step by step basis.
6) The trie tree milestone was an excellent time for me to get better familiar with the debugger and on how to use a step by step 
debugging technique. I essentially had to break through every line of code to see which node was currently being pointed to.
7) My next focus is to get my editor to output the list of finished words in a box for the user to select. I plan on using a box 
function, that will update the cursor from the indexes my 2D array is utilizing, that will output every instance of a possible finished 
string for the user. From there, the user can interact with the box, that will be in a new window, by scrolling up and down and select 
which word - which will then output to the main window.
