1. The greatest challenge I ran into in this project was on how to implement the priority queue, and then switch the decimal values into 
a unique binary value. I mulled over a few ways, and ultimately chose using a binary array technique I had read online about. While not 
the most efficient nor prettiest, it was the only technique I felt fully comfortable implementing from scratch. I am still unsure on how 
to properly implemenmt a binary operator to this particular assignment, but plan on going back to mess around with it to get a greater 
understanding.
2. There are 2 primary challenges in this milestone I still need to fix and work on. First off, I need to find a way to output the 
priority queue as a queue rather than a stack, and not outputting the from the top. I've considered possibly switching the max for a min 
heap, but it would be much better habit to just implement properly. I also need to work on assigning a unique binary value, rather than 
just converting from decimal to binary. I've considered doing a check to see if a partiular unique value has been assigned yet, and if 
so, incrementing the value until it has a unqiue value.
3. For this assignment, I found running the code given and testing out a few methods I read about gave me a greater understanding of how 
to implement all of the data strucutres that were used in this assignment. It definitely helped soldified my understanding of hash 
tables/maps, and exposed me to the concept of priority queues and heaps.
4. Most of my time was spent working on implementing the priority queue along with the decimal to binary value converter. I had to be 
very conscious of the order in which to implement.
5. This milestone improved my understanding of how to utilize unordered maps, and differents ways in which they are often used.
6. My next objective is to switch out the test input function I have to run the code with the output file that gets directly saved from 
my text editor. Afterwards, I will focus on my issues previously stated.
